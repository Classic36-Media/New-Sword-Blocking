## Features

* Newly crafted swords can be used to block attacks by right-clicking while holding the sword in the main hand
* Swords block a percentage of damage from incoming attacks and lose durability points for each attack blocked, based on the material type of the sword:

| :--: | :--: | :--: |
Wooden | 20% | 7
Golden | 25% | 9
Stone | 30% | 5
Iron | 40% | 4
Diamond | 50% | 3
Netherite | 60% | 2

\* per 10 damage blocked
